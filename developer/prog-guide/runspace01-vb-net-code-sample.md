# Runspace01 (VB.NET) Code Sample
Here are the code samples for the runspace described in [Creating a Console Application That Runs a Specified Command &#91;ps&#93;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/793a6570-a072-4799-840b-172f28ce620e). To do this, the application invokes a runspace, and then invokes a command. (Note that this application does not specify runspace configuration information, nor does it explicitly create a pipeline.) The command that is invoked is the Get-Process cmdlet.
