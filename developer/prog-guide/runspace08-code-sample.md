# RunSpace08 Code Sample
Here is the source code for the Runspace08 sample described in [Creating a Console Application That Adds Parameters to a Command &#91;ps&#93;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/848b2b46-60f1-4a86-b448-cfc7c0cccfba). This sample application creates a runspace, creates a pipeline, adds two commands to the pipeline, adds two parameters to the second command, and then executes the pipeline. The commands that are added to the pipeline are the Get-Process and Sort-Object cmdlets.
