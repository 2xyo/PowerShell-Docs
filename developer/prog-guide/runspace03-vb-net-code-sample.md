# RunSpace03 (VB.NET) Code Sample
Here is the VB.NET source code for the console application described in [Creating a Console Application That Runs a Specified Script &#91;ps&#93;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a93e6006-36db-4bcc-b9da-c5bebf4ffd68). This sample uses the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke) class to execute a script that retrieves process information for the list of process names passed into the script. It shows how to pass input objects to a script and how to retrieve error objects as well as the output objects.
